Variable Naming Conventions

*Do not use common names for variables and functions:
    Example: user, addUser()

*CamelCase for variables and function names:
    Example: patientRecord, calculateTotal, isEligibleForAppointment

*Use descriptive names that indicate the role of the variable or function:
    Example: patientList (for a list of patients), calculateTotalBill (for a function calculating the total bill), appointmentDate (for the date of an appointment).
    Avoid abbreviations unless they are widely accepted or well-understood (e.g., num, count).

*Constants should be in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE:
    Example: MAX_PATIENTS, API_URL

*Avoid generic names like data, temp, info. These donâ€™t tell anyone what the variable holds.
    Example: Instead of data, use patientData, appointmentInfo, etc.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Function Naming Conventions

*Use action-oriented names for functions (usually verbs):
    Example: addPatient(), deleteRecord(), fetchAppointmentDetails()

*Functions that return a boolean should be named with is, can, or has 
    (e.g., isPatientEligible(), canScheduleAppointment()).

----------------------------------------------------------------
File and Folder Naming

*Use kebab-case for file and folder names:
    Example: patient-record.js, appointment-form.js, components/appointment-list/

*Keep file names descriptive of their contents:
    Example: patientList.js, appointmentDetails.js
